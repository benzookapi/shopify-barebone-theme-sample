# Overview
This is an _unoffical_ sample code for scratch building [Shopify theme](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes) _without_ [cloning Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn) for understanding the [theme architecture](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture) with simpler and fewer [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid) code.

If you are a theme beginner and feel it tough to grab the high volume source code of Dawn, this basic theme may work as a tutorial, instead.
